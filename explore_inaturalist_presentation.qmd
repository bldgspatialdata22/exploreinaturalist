# Initial goals for project

1.  Improve skills in R.
2.  Compare ease of data retrieval from open-source databases, including iNaturalist, GBIF, and iMap.
3.  Begin assessing the completeness, or accuracy, of data publicly-sourced data from iNaturalist. Find comparative measures based on biodiversity counts determined from each database's datasets.
4.  Determine best use of iNaturalist data for research purposes.
5.  Deliver project documentation, data visualization (possibly small multiples)

# How my goals changed

1.  Improve skills in R.
2.  Compare ease of data retrieval from open-source databases, including iNaturalist, GBIF, ~~and iMap.~~
3.  ~~Begin assessing the completeness, or accuracy, of data publicly-sourced data from iNaturalist. Find comparative measures based on biodiversity counts determined from each database's datasets.~~
4.  ~~Determine best use of iNaturalist data for research purposes.~~
5.  Deliver project documentation, data visualization ~~(possibly small multiples)~~

::: notes
Spent a lot of time learning how to use R, which data to work with, and exploring rinat and rgbif

# Data sources

iNaturalist

1.  Maryland Master Naturalist project data

    -   [Piedmont Region](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/maryland-master-naturalist-program-piedmont-region)
    -   [Coastal Region](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/maryland-master-naturalist-program-coastal-plain)

2.  [Maryland Biodiversity project data](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/maryland-biodiversity-project)

3.  Global Biodiversity Information Facility

    -   [iNaturalist Research-Grade Observations](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?dataset_key=50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7)

::: notes
Open-source data created by users

1.  Free to use
2.  Creates online community
3.  Projects are used to record biodiversity inventories of varying scopes

Each organization structures data differently. iNat houses original user data, whereas GBIF hosts data from numerous publishers. So, iNat data has a lot of user attribute data whereas GBIF has alot of different taxonomic attributes attached to a each observation

## Resources

-   rinat, rgbif (Accessing data through APIs)
-   tidyverse (For tidying data)
    -   dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, sf, readr
-   janitor
-   mapboxapi (base maps)
-   DataCamp, package documentation, iNaturalist and GBIF API documentation

# Challenges

-   What challenges did you encounter in making use of these resources and this data?
    -   Learning R syntax and tools

    -   Understanding how to apply package documentation

    -   Wrapping my head around how to create a project workflow

::: notes
-   What is actually happening when I run a line of code, and how do I fix it if it doesn't work?
-   The proper order in which to perform data transformations
-   ei.: df -\> sf -\> then transform crs
-   ggplot aesthetics in particular
:::

# Small Wins

-   I feel much more confident using R as a whole
-   I learned alot about iNaturalist and GBIF
-   Working with R packages that would with APIs

::: notes
-   Gained experience using online documentation to troubleshoot errors
-   Learned project documentation skills
-   Created data visualizations of iNaturalist data
:::

# Approaches or ideas for the future

-   Narrow scope of project down to one dataset
-   Develop a workflow for answers broader questions about data structure
-   Then implement workflow with more datasets

::: notes
I thought I was starting with a really simple idea that could be built upon further down the line, but what I actually did was start with a slab of marble and chipped away small pieces
